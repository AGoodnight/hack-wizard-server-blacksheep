# Simple Server
Install Python3, on windows I recommend using the executable from here, on Mac os you can use brew.

## Setup the Virtual Environment 

```bash
py -m venv env

source env/bin/activate #on Mac
bash env/Scripts/activate #on Windows
```
Once you have the Virtaul Envoronment running you can install the required packages within it to run the server.

```bash
(env) pip install -e .
```
